## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

### `npm run server`
Simulates the backend using db.json. It uses port 3001.
